# RR-2-WeatherAnalysis
## Reproducible Research assignment 2

This is the repo for my Reproducible Research assignment 2, as part of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science course on Coursera. 
Only the R Markdown is stored here. This can be rendered to html in R Studio using knitr. The data is downloaded by the code. 
The output is available here: <http://rpubs.com/timgbeard/278970>
